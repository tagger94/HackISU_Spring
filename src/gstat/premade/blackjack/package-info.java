 * Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is the most widely played casino banking
 * game in the world.[1] Blackjack is a comparing card game between a player and
 * dealer, meaning that players compete against the dealer but not against any
 * other players. It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards. The object of
 * the game is to beat the dealer, which can be done in a number of ways:
 * 
 * Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a blackjack), without a
 * dealer blackjack; Reach a final score higher than the dealer without
 * exceeding 21; or Let the dealer draw additional cards until his or her hand
 * exceeds 21. The player or players are dealt an initial two-card hand and add
 * together the value of their cards. Face cards (kings, queens, and jacks) are
 * counted as ten points. A player and the dealer can count their own ace as 1
 * point or 11 points. All other cards are counted as the numeric value shown on
 * the card. After receiving their initial two cards, players have the option of
 * getting a "hit", or taking an additional card. In a given round, the player
 * or the dealer wins by having a score of 21 or by having the highest score
 * that is less than 21. Scoring higher than 21 (called "busting" or
 * "going bust") results in a loss. A player may win by having any final score
 * equal to or less than 21 if the dealer busts.
